## Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running.

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) TasteBud is known to work using node v20.11.1 and npm v10.2.4.

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:StanfordCS194/Win24-Team22.git
   ```

### Frontend

1. Move into the `frontend` directory.

    ```sh
    cd Win24-Team22/frontend
    ```

1. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

1. Start the development server

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

### Backend

1. Move into the `backend` directory.

    ```sh
    cd Win24-Team22/backend
    ```

1. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

_Known issue: if you get the error `ReferenceError: Headers is not defined` upon starting the backend, you need to use a newer version of Node.js - check out the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for help. TasteBud is known to work using node v20.11.1 and npm v10.2.4._

Once the frontend and backend are both running, visit <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser to begin using TasteBud!
